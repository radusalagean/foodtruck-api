# foodtruck-api
Node.js API based on the one presented in https://www.udemy.com/api-development.

Building on that base, the following features have been added:
- Image support for foodtrucks and user accounts
- Auto generation of thumbnails
- Better error handling
- Rating support for reviews
- Queries for foodtrucks return average rating and rating count, based on the associated reviews
- Ownership for submitted foodtruck and review entities (Only the original authors can edit or remove them)
- Other improvements

## Usage
Base URL: `https://releasetracker.app/foodtruck-api/v1/`

Requests marked as `ðŸ”’ Authenticated`, you need to have the `Authorization` header set with the value built as `Bearer {token}`, where `{token}` is the token received with the login call.

For all POST / PUT requests that have a json body provided, you need to set the `application/json` value for the `Content-Type` header.

For all POST requests that involve uploading images, you need to set the `multipart/form-data` value for the `Content-Type` header.

Tokens have a lifetime of 30 days, after which they will expire and a new token has to be requested through a new login call for that user. The token is reset for a user with each login call.

In the documentation, certain attributes with a colon in the begining (ex. `:id`), need to be replaced with a value when you are making the call.
